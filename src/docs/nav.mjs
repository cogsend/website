/**
 * The documentation navigation: one list, in the order a reader meets it.
 *
 * It is a plain `.mjs` file because two very different things read it: the
 * pages (sidebar, prev/next, the index cards) and `scripts/sync-docs.mjs`,
 * which needs to know which file in the app repo becomes which page here.
 * A `.ts` file would have been fine for the pages and unreadable to the script.
 *
 * `slug` is the URL: `/docs/<slug>/` and the name of the extras file that goes
 * with it. `source` is the file in the app repo's `docs/` folder — the app owns
 * the words, this file only owns where they sit and what the page is called.
 *
 * @typedef {{ slug: string; title: string; description: string; source?: string }} DocsItem
